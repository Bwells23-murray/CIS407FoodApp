# CIS407FoodApp
Duo Project for CIS407, where we need to make a Food ordering app with a specification on database useage, where we can have users register, sign in, order food, and track their orders. 

# HOW TO RUN THE APP!!!!!!!!!!!!
    okay, this is incredibly important for how you need to run the app.

    Step 1. open the terminal and do "npm install" this should download all Node dependancies required to run this (SQLite3 and express specifically)

    Step 2: run "pip install requirements.txt" to run the requirements denoted in the requiremnets.txt file 

    Step 3: attempt to start the server by navigating into the backend folder and doing "node server.js", this should... in theory start the server, 
        if you are getting a "MODULE NOT FOUND" first look for if it tells you and error, if it doesn't then make sure you are in the right folder.  if that still doesnt work make sure you have SQLite3 and express installed, it has given us nothing but issues.

    Step 4: run the McDougals.py file, it should pop-up the frontend with a login or register screen. feel free to register if you want to make a new regualar user account for yourself, if not you can use our premades
